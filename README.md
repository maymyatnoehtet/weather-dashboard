Use the 5 Day Weather Forecast to an external site. to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.


- Will use OpenWeather API to retrieve the 5 days weather data of the cities.
